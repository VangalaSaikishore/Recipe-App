Welcome to Recipe App project! This project was bootstrapped using Vite, a fast build tool for modern web development.

i> The Recipe App is a web application that allows users to browse, search, and view different recipes.
ii> Users can see a list of recipes, click on a recipe to view its details, and search for specific recipes by keywords. 
iii> Here it will give you complete information regarding preparation time, ingredients, steps to prepare the recipe, nutrition of the particular recipe.
