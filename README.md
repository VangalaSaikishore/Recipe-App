Welcome to your React project! This project was bootstrapped using Vite, a fast build tool for modern web development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/ (LTS version recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd your-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will build and serve your React application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build

To create a production-ready build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized and minified files in the `dist` directory.

## Project Structure

- `public`: Contains static assets that will be served as-is.
- `src`: Contains your application's source code.
  - `App.js`: The main entry point for your React application.
  - Other components, styles, and resources.

## Customizing Configuration

If you need to customize the Vite configuration, modify the `vite.config.js` file. Refer to the Vite documentation for more details: https://vitejs.dev/config/

## Additional Commands

Here are some additional commands you might find useful:

- Run tests:

  ```sh
  npm test
  ```

- Start a local server with the production build:

  ```sh
  npm run serve
  ```

- Clean the build directory:

  ```sh
  npm run clean
  ```
